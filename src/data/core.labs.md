The **Underground Society** aims to solve a recurrent issue that buyers face when exploring the NFT market by offering the community a new way to acquire NFTs. Accordingly, the Underground Society is breaking the barrier between NFT and DeFi by allowing NFT investors to **leverage themselves** by easily accessing liquidity to purchase NFTs.

This issue that has been attempted to be solved by fractionalization, serialization & P2P NFT collateralization with mitigated success because of the complexity of these products.

The Underground Society plans to simplify the process.

> Ever wanted to buy an NFT for **50% of its price**? And pay it off overtime?  **That time is now**. 

Select your desired NFT and input how much liquidity you have to put in for the purchase. We grant the rest of liquidity needed and hold the NFT in escrow until **you** decide to pay off or sell the NFT.
