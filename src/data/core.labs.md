The **Underground Society** aims to solve a recurrent issue that buyers face when exploring the NFT market by offering the community a new way to acquire NFTs. Accordingly, the Underground Society is breaking the barrier between NFT and DeFi by allowing NFT investors to **leverage themselves** by easily accessing liquidity to purchase NFTs.

This issue that has been attempted to be solved by fractionalization, serialization & P2P NFT collateralization with mitigated success because of the complexity and lack of visibility of these products.

The Underground Society plans to simplify the buying process as well as offer a unique solution that will allow everyone to buy blue-chips out of their price range on magic eden.

> Ever wanted to buy an NFT for **50% of its price**? And pay it off overtime?  **That time is now**. 

The user will select the desired NFT and inputs how much liquidity they have to put in for the purchase. When ready, the user hits “buy” and the protocol grants the rest of liquidity needed and buys then holds the NFT in escrow until the user decides to pay off or sell the NFT.
