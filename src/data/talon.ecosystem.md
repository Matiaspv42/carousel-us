Every Underground Society NFT holder that stakes his or her NFT/s will get granted 10 $TALON tokens per day, per NFT staked. Token emission is linear, and supply is uncapped.

Depreciation of $TALON will be countered back by use cases for the token.
Get access to the auction house where NFTs will be auctioned in SOL.
Get access to the Cedar toolbox and pay in $TALON. Create your project without spending SOL
Get access to holder auctions where NFTs will be auctioned in $TALON.

This should keep a consistent balance between emission and burn thus warranting holders and stakers a valuable token as well as enjoying discounted access to utilities developed by the team.
