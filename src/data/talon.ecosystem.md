Every Underground Society NFT holder that stakes his or her NFT/s will get granted 10 $TALON tokens per day, per NFT staked. Token emission is linear, and supply is uncapped.

Depreciation of $TALON will be countered back by use cases for the token:
- Get access to the auction house where NFTs will be auctioned in SOL.
- Get access to the Cedar Pro and pay in $TALON. Create your project without spending SOL
- Get access to holder auctions where NFTs will be auctioned in $TALON.
- Participate in Dutch auction WL allocation. Only paid for in $TALON
- Participate in Dutch auction raffles. Only paid for in $TALON
- PFP upgrade via $TALON for bolstered utilities
- $TALON will be your entry to compete in the raffles for blue-chip or desirable up in coming NFT projects.


On top of all of this, users will be able to pay for protocol fees as well as future developments of other tools in $TALON.

This will keep a consistent balance between emission and burn thus warranting holders and stakers a valuable token as well as enjoying discounted access to utilities developed by the team.
