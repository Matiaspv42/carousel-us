**Cedar CLI** is a conditional NFT generator for the Solana blockchain. It's part of [Underground Society's Cedar](https://cedar.undergroundsociety.xyz) utility.
Based on graph theory, it composes and generates images from layers, with their associated json metadata file. These json files
follow [Metaplex](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/token-standard)'s NFT standard.

This project has been inspired by [Hashlips Art Engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine), which is fine
but is lacking some features regarding **multi-layering** and **conditions**.
We wanted to be able to have some attributes only if some other attributes were present for example. Or force a second
layer which wouldn't be an attribute:
like hair, split in 2 layers because of some hats (you would have part of the hair underneath the hat and the other part
on top).

Cedar CLI is open source. **It is free forever**.

We offer consulting services around that tool with full support to help you generate a collection. We also provide **OpenAI** integrations for NFT names and descriptions, and soon, fully customizable minting platforms.
