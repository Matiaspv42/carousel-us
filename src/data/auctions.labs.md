The Underground Society will also be the venue for unique raffles and auctions for holders and the general public. 
Liquidated NFTs from our protocol will be transferred to the **auction house**. 

Blue chips or on-the-rise NFT projects to be auctioned off to the community for lower than the floor price, some times dramatically. 
Entry will be free for holders. 

When we grow the Underground Society as big as we intend, we expect many auctions each week, even each day.
